## Welcome to Breadr! 

Use this tool to help you calculate the amount of time needed for your bake! The "Today's Bake Calculator" allows users to time their bake from starter to bake. This tool, broken down into seven steps, takes the user through feeding the start to timing thier final bake time!
<br>

### Step One: Prep the Starter
First find the time your starter will be ready by enterign the time the starter was fed, the water temperature, and the ambient temperature. 

### Step Two: Mix Leaven
In step two, find the time the leaven will be ready by entering the time leaven was added, the feeding time, the temperature of the leaven, and ambient temperature. 

### Step Three: Mix Dough
Next, the user will calculate the time the dough mixture will be ready by entering the start time, water temperature, flour temperature, and autolyse time in minutes. 

### Step Four: Bulk Fermentation
Then, the bulk fermentation is calculated by entering the mix start time after the autolyse stage. Enter the ambient temperature to find the time when the bulk fermentation will be complete. 

### Step Five: Divide and Shape Dough
Then, in the fifth step, begin by entering rest start time, length of rest time, the temperature of the dough, and the ambient temperature. Once the bench rest is done, divide the dough and begin the final rise stage. 

### Step Six: Final Rise/Proofing
First, enter the end bench rest time, ambient temperature, and proofing time length to find what time your proof will be ready.

### Step Seven: Bake!
Finally, time your bake with the starting oven temperature and length of bake in minutes to see when your bake will be prepared!
